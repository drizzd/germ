Hi,

I'm using pso 0.98.D-beta with python2.3.

Sometimes, the headers get sent _after_ the actual content. As a workaround I commented out 'if not self.headers_sent:' in the close member function of RequestIO so I can call send_http_header() directly at the beginning of the handler (right after setting some headers).

I haven't figured what causes this problem exactly. Unfortunately my code is quite complex, so maybe you have a better idea where to start looking.

My cgi script looks like this:

#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/home/drizzd/lpms")

from germ.ui_ht.handler import handler
from pso.service import ServiceHandler
ServiceHandler().run(handler)

The handler essentially looks like this:

def handler(req):
    try:
        prevent_caching(req)

        req.pso().send_http_header()

        import cgi
        form = cgi.FieldStorage(keep_blank_values = True)

        # [...] lots of stuff,
        # also using req.pso().session,
        # but never any printing

        print parser.output()
    except:
        from boil_out import boil_out
        return boil_out()

    from pso.service import OK
    return OK

Best regards,
Clemens
