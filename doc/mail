Summary: Abandoned project takeover: germ (PEND/12)

Initial Comment:
I would like to submit my project for hosting on SourceForge.net based on the following information.  It is my understanding that the UNIX name I selected is currently in use (either by another active project, a deleted project, or by an &quot;on-hold&quot; project).  This Tracker item has been autogenerated by the Project Registration system (https://sourceforge.net/register/) on SourceForge.net.The settings (priority, assignee, etc.) of this request should not be changed except by SourceForge.net staff.  A response to this inquiry should be provided by SourceForge.net staff within 5 business days (the SourceForge.net team works at least Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm Pacific, excepting holidays).  Should you need to inquire regarding the status of this project takeover request, please add a comment to this Support Request.

The status of this request may be checked on the My SF.net Projects page at: https://sourceforge.net/my/myprojects.php

1. Submitter: drizzd

Unique token: b06c1ada2c85c33e449ec59e6a8dbf68

2. UNIX name: germ

3. Descriptive name: Generic Entity-Relationship Model

4. License: gpl

License other: 

5. Public description: This system allows the definition of attributes, entities and relations as used in entity-relationship (ER) models. It will then handle input and representation of data appropriately.

6. Registration description: Generic Entity Relationship Model (GERM)

This system allows the definition of attributes, entities and relations as used
in entity-relationship (ER) models. It will then handle input and
representation of data appropriately.

The following actions are currently implemented: list, view, edit, delete and
submit. They correspond to the SQL commands SELECT, SELECT ... WHERE, UPDATE,
DELETE and INSERT.

The system also provides a framework for the implementation of a user interface
that will then be able to trigger various actions on specific entities. An HTTP
interface using HTML to represent and input data is available.

Furthermore, GERM provides an integrated privilege system. Apart from security
reasons this is also necessary for a complete constraint specification and to
ensure integrity of the data. The user interface should try not to provide any
illegal actions to spare the user annoying &#039;permission denied&#039; errors. The idea
is to hide information that&#039;s irrelevant to the user.

Consider the following example of a tournament planning system:

There is a number of tourneys available. For each tourney teams can be formed.
Each tourney requires a specific number of team members. In a real situation,
the user may not be able to join a particular team for various reasons. For
instance, the system should prevent the user from joining a team if he is
already a member of a team that partakes in the same tournament. Furthermore,
the limit for the number of team members must not be exceeded. Also, it should
not be possible to join a team if the tournament has already started or if it
is already finished. The system might want to check that the user has paid the
entrance fee before allowing to join a team, etc.

Each of these conditions can easily be ensured by defining the appropriate
relations and constraints. This information can then be used to determine if a
menu entry should be made available to the user depending on wether or not the
user is currently able to join _any_ team at all.


o Programming Language: Python 2.3

o Libraries: Python DB Libraries, Apache mod-python (for HTTP user interface),
  Tcl/Tk (for Tcl/Tk user interface)

o Databases: Currently, only MySQL, any with Python database API support in the
  future

o OS platforms: Any supported by Python and the required libraries

o Features:

  - Ensures data consistency by resolving relations and constraints.
  - Generates appropriate input forms.
  - Object-oriented implementation to be easily extensible and flexible.
  - Separates data related and user interface related (i.e., data input and
    output) code.
  - Seperates generic data related code (like dealing with relations,
    contraints, permission) and code related to specific data (like the
    generation of games for a tournament).

o Technical Problems:

  - Handling all data in a generic way and still provide all kinds of possible
    requirements to complex data structures.
  - Providing extensibility and flexibility for the programmer while still
    being easy to use and adapt to the needs of an end user.

o Solution specific to a particular web site:

  Even though this system was designed with a particular application in mind
  (i.e. a LAN Party and Tournament Planning System), it was not intended to be
  specific to this use.

o Services:

  I plan to host a demonstration of the system. The basic features of the
  system are implemented and I have a testing application running on my
  machine.

  I plan to provide a forum for development of GERM.

o Differences to other CMSs

  GERM is really more of a library than it is a complete system. It needs a
  rather low-level description (essentially, an entity-relationship model) of
  the data it is supposed to manage. It has many more possible uses than just a
  news or message board. I even consider using it for an accounting program.

  Other CMSs also seem to be restricted to the Webserver/Browser environment.
  To GERM, that&#039;s just one possible user interface.

I don't understand what the 'Change to Closed status' 
message means. I was told to wait for 2 weeks, or until the 
project owner approves of the takover, which he does.

Now what am I supposed to do?

Greetings,

An e-mail has been sent to the administrators of the current
project. During this 2 week wait period, the administrator has
the option to either:

1. Deny the transfer of the project (at which time you should
submit a new Project Registration using an alternate UNIX name).

2. Allow the transfer of the project, which we will then process.

3. No response from the administrator, at which time (in 2 weeks)
we will handle as if it were allowed by the administrator.

You also have the option of cancelling this request. To do so, go to:

https://www.sf.net/my/

Click on the APT in question and then cancel the request. Do note
that this is the final step in the process prior to handing over
control of the UNIX name in question to you.

Thank you,

It is my understanding that the UNIX name I selected is currently in use (either by another active project, a deleted project, or by an &quot;on-hold&quot; project).  This Tracker item has been autogenerated by the Project Registration system (https://sourceforge.net/register/) on SourceForge.net.The settings (priority, assignee, etc.) of this request should not be changed except by SourceForge.net staff.  A response to this inquiry should be provided by SourceForge.net staff within 5 business days (the SourceForge.net team works at least Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm Pacific, excepting holidays).  Should you need to inquire regarding the status of this project takeover request, please add a comment to this Support Request.

The status of this request may be checked on the My SF.net Projects page at: https://sourceforge.net/my/myprojects.php

6. Registration description: Generic Entity Relationship Model (GERM)

This system allows the definition of attributes, entities and relations as used
in entity-relationship (ER) models. It will then handle input and
representation of data appropriately.

The following actions are currently implemented: list, view, edit, delete and
submit. They correspond to the SQL commands SELECT, SELECT ... WHERE, UPDATE,
DELETE and INSERT.

The system also provides a framework for the implementation of a user interface
that will then be able to trigger various actions on specific entities. An HTTP
interface using HTML to represent and input data is available.

Furthermore, GERM provides an integrated privilege system. Apart from security
reasons this is also necessary for a complete constraint specification and to
ensure integrity of the data. The user interface should try not to provide any
illegal actions to spare the user annoying &#039;permission denied&#039; errors. The idea
is to hide information that&#039;s irrelevant to the user.

Consider the following example of a tournament planning system:

There is a number of tourneys available. For each tourney teams can be formed.
Each tourney requires a specific number of team members. In a real situation,
the user may not be able to join a particular team for various reasons. For
instance, the system should prevent the user from joining a team if he is
already a member of a team that partakes in the same tournament. Furthermore,
the limit for the number of team members must not be exceeded. Also, it should
not be possible to join a team if the tournament has already started or if it
is already finished. The system might want to check that the user has paid the
entrance fee before allowing to join a team, etc.

Each of these conditions can easily be ensured by defining the appropriate
relations and constraints. This information can then be used to determine if a
menu entry should be made available to the user depending on wether or not the
user is currently able to join _any_ team at all.


o Programming Language: Python 2.3

o Libraries: Python DB Libraries, Apache mod-python (for HTTP user interface),
  Tcl/Tk (for Tcl/Tk user interface)

o Databases: Currently, only MySQL, any with Python database API support in the
  future

o OS platforms: Any supported by Python and the required libraries

o Features:

  - Ensures data consistency by resolving relations and constraints.
  - Generates appropriate input forms.
  - Object-oriented implementation to be easily extensible and flexible.
  - Separates data related and user interface related (i.e., data input and
    output) code.
  - Seperates generic data related code (like dealing with relations,
    contraints, permission) and code related to specific data (like the
    generation of games for a tournament).

o Technical Problems:

  - Handling all data in a generic way and still provide all kinds of possible
    requirements to complex data structures.
  - Providing extensibility and flexibility for the programmer while still
    being easy to use and adapt to the needs of an end user.

o Solution specific to a particular web site:

  Even though this system was designed with a particular application in mind
  (i.e. a LAN Party and Tournament Planning System), it was not intended to be
  specific to this use.

o Services:

  I plan to host a demonstration of the system. The basic features of the
  system are implemented and I have a testing application running on my
  machine.

  I plan to provide a forum for development of GERM.

o Differences to other CMSs

  GERM is really more of a library than it is a complete system. It needs a
  rather low-level description (essentially, an entity-relationship model) of
  the data it is supposed to manage. It has many more possible uses than just a
  news or message board. I even consider using it for an accounting program.

  Other CMSs also seem to be restricted to the Webserver/Browser environment.
  To GERM, that&#039;s just one possible user interface.

I approve of the takeover. The project is indeed dead, so go
for it. Hope you are successful with your project!

Greetings,

An e-mail has been sent to the administrators of the current
project. During this 2 week wait period, the administrator has
the option to either:

1. Deny the transfer of the project (at which time you should
submit a new Project Registration using an alternate UNIX name).

2. Allow the transfer of the project, which we will then process.

3. No response from the administrator, at which time (in 2 weeks)
we will handle as if it were allowed by the administrator.

You also have the option of cancelling this request. To do so, go to:

https://www.sf.net/my/

Click on the APT in question and then cancel the request. Do note
that this is the final step in the process prior to handing over
control of the UNIX name in question to you.

Thank you,

Greetings,

You are receiving this mail because you are a project admin for
a SourceForge.net-hosted project. One of our primary services,
CVS, suffered a series of interrelated, critical hardware failures
in recent weeks. We understand how frustrating this CVS outage
must be to you and your users; however, our top priority remains
preservation of the integrity of your data.

The series of CVS hardware failures prompted us to expedite the
deployment of planed improvements to our CVS infrastructure,
drawing upon much of the knowledge that we gained from our
Subversion deployment. Our improved CVS service architecture,
which we plan to deploy tomorrow afternoon (2006-05-12), will
offer greater performance and stability and will eliminate several
single points of failure.

The Site Status page (https://www.sf.net/docs/A04) will be
updated as soon as the new infrastructure is rolled out. In the
interim, please read the important information provided below
to learn about how these changes will affect your project.


Summary of changes, effective 2006-05-12:


1. Hostname for CVS service

Old: cvs.sourceforge.net

New: PROJECT_UNIX_NAME.cvs.sourceforge.net

This change will require new working copies to be checked out of all
repositories (so control files in the working copy will point to the
right place). We will be updating the instructions we supply, but
instructions that your team has written within documentation, etc. will
need to be updated.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gaim co gaim

would be changed to

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@gaim.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gaim co gaim



2. ViewCVS

We are moving from ViewCVS to its successor, ViewVC. ViewVC is
currently in use for our Subversion service.



3. Sync delay

Old: CVS pserver, tarballs and ViewCVS provided against a separate
server which is a minimum of three hours behind developer CVS.

New: ViewVC will be provided against developer CVS (it will be current).
CVS pserver will be provided against a secondary server (not developer
server) with a maximum expected delay of two hours.

Follow-up work is planned (this infrastructure takes us 80% of the way)
to essentially eliminate the sync delay.



4. Read-only rsync service

As a new service offering, we are now providing read-only rsync access
against developer CVS. This allows projects to efficiently make
on-demand backups of their entire CVS repository.

All projects should be making regular backups of their CVS repository
contents using this service.



5. Nightly tarball service

Nightly tarball service is being dropped in lieu of read-only rsync
service. Projects which currently depend on nightly tarballs for
repository backups will need to begin using rsync to make a backup copy
of their repository contents.

We see this as a major functional improvement. For a number of reasons,
tarballs have fallen out of sync with the data in the repository at
times in the past few years. Tarballs required a substantial amount of
additional disk, and I/O to generate. The move to read-only rsync
allows backups to be produced on-demand, with an update frequency chosen
by the project.



6. Points of failure

In the past, developer CVS service for all projects was provided from a
single host. CVS pserver service was provided from individual backend
heads based on a split of the data.

Under our new design, developer CVS and most of our CVS-related services
are provided from one of ten CVS hosts (count subject to increase with
growth). Each host is independent, and makes a backup copy of the
repository data of another host (which is used to provide the pserver
CVS service).

Failure of a single host will impact only the availability of data on
that host. Since the data is split among a larger number of hosts, the
size of data impacted by an individual host outage is substantially
smaller, and the time required for us to restore service will be
substantially shorter.

This rapid architecture change has been made possible specifically using
the research we performed for our recent launch of Subversion service.
We've applied our best practices, produced a substantial amount of
internal documentation, and kept an eye toward maintainability.
This effort has allowed us to deploy this new architecture quickly
once hardware was received, and will permit us to quickly scale
this service horizontally as growth and demand requires. 



Many other minor improvements have also been made to improve the service
offering and make it less trouble-prone. The most important of which are
listed above. For a full description of the new service offering, and
for information on how to use the services described above, please refer
to the site documentation for the CVS service after the service has been
launched: https://www.sf.net/docs/E04


Thank you,

Greetings,

You are receiving this mail because you are listed as an administrator 
of a SourceForge.net project that has active mailing lists.  As a 
continued measure to improve our service offering, we are migrating all 
existing mailing lists to Mailman 2.1.8 (latest stable release).  This 
is the first major upgrade to the Mailman software used for mailing list 
service in more than four years.  We expect this upgrade to both improve 
security and performance, and to provide a number of features not 
available in our existing Mailman service offering.

We have been testing the new mailing list infrastructure for several 
weeks with the assistance of a few select projects.  Our general 
migration of all mailing lists to this new infrastructure will begin 
2006-05-23.  Migration is being handled in several one-day segments and 
minimal downtime for list service is expected.

Before the migration begins in earnest, we wanted to provide you this 
notice of some specific service changes:

1. Our new Mailman install will no longer permit the editing of HTML 
page templates and existing customizations to these templates will not 
be migrated.  We made this decision to ensure consistency of the UI 
among all projects, allow future upgrades without worry about the 
compatibility of customized templates, eliminate issues related to 
broken or corrupt templates.

In lieu of template modification, we encourage projects to provide list 
details and instructions via the "introductory description" list 
configuration option. This option supports basic HTML, so should be 
powerful enough for conveying intended information, while adhering to 
common look and feel.


2. List archival is implicitly enabled.  It is not possible to opt-out 
of mailing list archival.

As per our Mailing List site documentation 
(http://sf.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=12983&group_id=1#mlarchives), 
list archival is mandatory.  In reviewing data to be migrated, we have 
discovered a small number of older lists which had archiving turned 
off.  The ability to disable archival is no longer supported, and 
archives will be maintained for all lists.  If you currently run lists 
without archival, we encourage you to revisit the perceived need for 
unarchived lists (for example, we have found unarchived lists that were 
used for the distribution of centralized team passwords, and upon review 
by the project, it was clear that this was a practice which should be 
changed).

Control over access to your mailing list archives is established on a 
per-list basis from the mailing list administration page for your 
project on the SourceForge.net site.  Lists in a 'deleted' status will 
not have web-visible archives.  Individual mailing list posts may be 
excluded from view by project administrators from the mailing list 
archive pages.  Additional details on data visibility may be found at: 
http://sf.net/docs/G03#mailing_lists


Questions or concerns regarding the mailing list service upgrade may be 
raised at: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=1&atid=200001

Thank you,

The SourceForge.net team

1. Germ as server forking off a process/thread for each cgi request
(initiated by apache), possibly restarting itself if changes are
detected.

Reason: Initialization (computationally intensive and possibly including
db requests)
Issues: Reentrant entities vs. copies from initialization

2. If (1) is done, we could allow FKs to be simply references to other
tables, where they get their info.

3. If (2) is done, join tables should be easy to do.

Issues: Resolve relation conditions from joined tables. I think this is
the real challenge. :-$
