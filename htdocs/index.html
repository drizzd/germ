<center><h2>germ - The Generic Entity-Relationship Model</h2></center>

<h4>News</h4>
<p><b>2006-08-14</b>: The system has now been tested by a number of users. It
works in principle, but, as expected, the user interface is currently
counter-intuitive and cumbersome. I received a lot of input and hopefully I
will come around to improve on the points made. Up to now, however, I
concentrated on fixing bugs and I finished the tournament planning system.
<p><b>2006-06-24</b>: I added a whole lot of small features in the last few
days. Germ already supports most of the features I need for lpms, so I will
soon start with the tournament system (single/double elimination), which will
no doubt pose new challenges to germ. My hope is that the farther development
goes, the less I will have to change about germ itself. After all, germ is the
<i>generic</i> ER model.</p>
<p>The most notable new feature is probably the <q>list</q> action and the
possibility to customize HTML output by special HTML tags. See <a
	href="/lpms/htdocs/news.html">news.html</a> as an example.</p>
<p><b>2005-12-30</b>: I finally came around to install a first demonstration.
You can view it <a href="/cgi-bin/lpms.py">here</a>. It's quite a complex
example of how you can use germ. There's also a diagram of the ER model.</p>

<p>For testing there are two staff-users <i>teststaff</i> and <i>teststaff2</i>
(password equals username). Can you determine <i>testasdf</i>'s identity?</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/lpms">lpms source code</a>: <q>cf.py</q> contains
	configuration variables used by germ, <q>entity</q> contains the
	entity-relationship specification, <q>htdocs</q> contains the html
	template.</li>
	<li><a href="/cgi-bin/lpms.py">/cgi-bin/lpms.py</a>: This is the start-up
	script.  It executes germ and points it to lpms.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Project Description</h4>

<p>
	This document describes the overall ideas and goals of germ:
	<a href="README">README</a>
</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

germ is still under development and not ready for end users. If you want
to try it nevertheless you need the following:
<ul>
	<li>A webserver which allows execution of cgi scripts</li>
	<li>A mysql database server</li>
	<li>You also need <a href="http://pso.sourceforge.net">pso</a>, a set of
	python scripts which germ uses for web session management. I simply
	downloaded their latest release.</li>
	<li>You can get germ via <a href="#cvs">CVS</a> or by downloading the
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=149467&package_id=164977&release_id=381670">prerelease</a></li>
</ul>
