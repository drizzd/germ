more or less solved bugs:

- edit news (logged out): I think the problem is that we have PKs without
  edit/submit permission now.
  Update: Ok, looks like this was my fault. But it seems to be awfully easy to
  make a mistake by having a relation condition for an action which is not
  permitted. I'll have to think about this.

- post news (logged out): Ok, this is really a problem with pre-locking the
  username if it does not exist. We could solve this by not setting an item
  parameter with non-existent session variables. If we then let an attempt to
  lock unset variables fail silently, the pre-locking is simply ignored.
  On the other hand, pre-locking seems to cause many errors. Maybe it would be
  better to forget pre-locking and use automatic locking (i.e., locking if
  there is only one choice) instead. But that still would not lock attributes
  right away, because we still want the user to be able to see that there is
  only one choice.

split germ action and entity files into different directories, like this:

action/* (action specific implementation)
entity/* (entity specific implementation)
erm/* (entity specifications)
