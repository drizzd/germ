- use get_cur_attr in dynamic permissions

- 'list' does not provide keys for limiting non-key attributes
- nmap -> seatplan
- auto-locking
- check for possible pre-locking errors
- add custom list actions, e.g. a custom tourney list

<list>
<entry>
	<p>
		<item action='edit'>
		<attr id='party'>
		<attr id='name'>
		<item action='list' table='$type'>,
		<item action='submit' table='teams'>
	</p>
</entry>
</list>

- add pre_edit/pre_submit/post_edit/post_submit methods
- add single elimination
- add manual
- add ranking for SE, DE (view table)
- 'head' feature for custom lists

future:

- allow selecting certain values in lists to limit the result (not only with
  PKs)
- possibly combine view and list action; a view is a list action which
  gradually reduces the results to one record
- allow german umlauts
- display tournament tree
- hash permission results

more or less solved bugs:

- edit news (logged out): I think the problem is that we have PKs without
  edit/submit permission now.
  Update: Ok, looks like this was my fault. But it seems to be awfully easy to
  make a mistake by having a relation condition for an action which is not
  permitted. I'll have to think about this.

- post news (logged out): Ok, this is really a problem with pre-locking the
  username if it does not exist. We could solve this by not setting an item
  parameter with non-existent session variables. If we then let an attempt to
  lock unset variables fail silently, the pre-locking is simply ignored.
  On the other hand, pre-locking seems to cause many errors. Maybe it would be
  better to forget pre-locking and use automatic locking (i.e., locking if
  there is only one choice) instead. But that still would not lock attributes
  right away, because we still want the user to be able to see that there is
  only one choice.
