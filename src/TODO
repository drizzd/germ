- 'list' does not provide keys for limiting non-key attributes
- nmap -> seatplan
- check for possible pre-locking errors
- add custom list actions, e.g. a custom tourney list

<list>
<entry>
	<p>
		<item action='edit'>
		<attr id='party'>
		<attr id='name'>
		<item action='list' entity='$type'>,
		<item action='submit' entity='team'>
	</p>
</entry>
</list>

For this it will also be necessary to construct an intermediate representation
of the parsed html text to allow iterating through list entries. (It's all in
my head.) The only open question is how to pass the PK mapping (kind of a join
condition) in the item tag. Currently, it's possible to specify attributes
directly using variables (like the entity='$type' example above), but using
that is not satisfying, because we would have to construct the entity object
for each entry. It would be much better to do that only once and to check if
the current entry corresponds to a PK in the result record.

So how can we do that syntactically without ruining the simple item concept?

Maybe, it would be enough to recognize our environment as a list and to
re-evaluate PKs for each entry.

The best solution would be one big join, which gives all the required
information. I'll have to think about that. I'm not sure this is even possible.

Another question is whether or not we should use a different syntax for
attribute variables, something like $a.type instead of simply $type, because
that could collide with regular variables like $userid.

- add pre_edit/pre_submit/post_edit/post_submit methods (see, for example,
  double_elimination)
- add single elimination
- add manual
- add ranking for SE, DE (view table)
- 'head' feature for custom lists

bugs:

- The 'date' type won't work as a key. It can not be set by a single string.

  Status: Solved, but untested.

future:

- allow selecting certain values in lists to limit the result (not only with
  PKs)
- possibly combine view and list action; a view is a list action which
  gradually reduces the results to one record
- allow german umlauts (and other special characters)
- display tournament tree
- hash permission results

more or less solved bugs:

- edit news (logged out): I think the problem is that we have PKs without
  edit/submit permission now.
  Update: Ok, looks like this was my fault. But it seems to be awfully easy to
  make a mistake by having a relation condition for an action which is not
  permitted. I'll have to think about this.

- post news (logged out): Ok, this is really a problem with pre-locking the
  username if it does not exist. We could solve this by not setting an item
  parameter with non-existent session variables. If we then let an attempt to
  lock unset variables fail silently, the pre-locking is simply ignored.
  On the other hand, pre-locking seems to cause many errors. Maybe it would be
  better to forget pre-locking and use automatic locking (i.e., locking if
  there is only one choice) instead. But that still would not lock attributes
  right away, because we still want the user to be able to see that there is
  only one choice.
